Simple tools for simple usage!

## Description
s.Tools is a collection of simple tools that are intended to make programming more convenient. On the one hand, there are simple things that are simply shortened by s.Tools, such as: Generating MD5 hashes or URL encoding / decoding without having to provide UTF-8 as a charset every time. But also more complicated functions like reading the System.out.println as a string are included.
